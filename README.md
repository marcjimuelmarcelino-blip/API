# ðŸ“š Library API (Express.js + JSON Storage)

A simple RESTful API for managing a library system built with Express.js.

ðŸš€ Features

GET all books or a single book by ID

POST a new book

PUT (update) an existing book

DELETE a book

Data stored in books.json (no database required)
